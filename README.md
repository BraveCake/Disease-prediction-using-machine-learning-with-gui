# Disease-prediction-using-machine-learning-with-gui 
Clinical Decision Support System
Due to big data progress in biomedical and healthcare communities, accurate
study of medical data benefits early disease recognition, patient care and
community services. When the quality of medical data is incomplete the
exactness of study is reduced. Moreover, different regions exhibit unique
appearances of certain regional diseases, which may results in weakening the
prediction of disease outbreaks. In this project, it bid a Machine learning
Decision tree map, Navie Bayes, Random forest algorithm by using structured
and unstructured data from hospital.
